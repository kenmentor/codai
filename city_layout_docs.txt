# City Layout Implementation using Tkinter

## Overview
This document explains how the initial city layout is created using the Tkinter library in Python. The layout is a simple graphical representation, including roads and buildings.

## Components
- **Tkinter Main Window**: Provides the main application window where the city layout is displayed.
- **Canvas**: A rectangular area intended for drawing operations.
- **Rectangles**: Used to represent parts of a city such as roads and buildings.

## Implementation Details
- The window title is set to 'Beautiful City Layout' and dimensions are set to 800x600.
- A canvas is created and packed into the main window with a light blue background.
- Roads are represented using gray rectangles:
  - A main horizontal road stretching across the window.
  - A vertical crossroad cutting through the main road.
- Buildings are represented using light coral colored rectangles, positioned across four quadrants of the window.

## Functions
- `create_city()`: Initializes the Tkinter window, sets up the canvas, and draws the roads and buildings.
- `window.mainloop()`: Starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the window to display and remain responsive.

## Usage
- Run `city_layout.py` to launch the window and view the city layout.

Feel free to expand upon this foundation by adding more elements to the city layout as needed.
